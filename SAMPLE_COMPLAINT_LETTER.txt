RE: Formal Notice of Habitability Violation - Cockroach Infestation
    [Your Address, Unit Number]

Dear [Landlord/Property Manager Name]:

I am writing to formally notify you of a serious cockroach infestation in my
rental unit at [Address, Unit Number]. This infestation constitutes a violation
of the implied warranty of habitability and requires immediate remediation.

DOCUMENTATION OF INFESTATION

I have been systematically documenting cockroach sightings in my unit using a
comprehensive tracking system. Attached to this letter is a detailed report
showing:

- Total number of sightings: [XX]
- Total number of cockroaches documented: [XX]
- Date range: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- Affected areas: [List primary locations, e.g., Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom]
- Photographic evidence of sightings

The attached report contains timestamped entries with photographic evidence,
location details, and comprehensive documentation of the scope and severity of
this infestation.

IMPACT ON HABITABILITY

This cockroach infestation has created the following conditions:

1. Health Hazards: Cockroaches are known vectors for disease, allergens, and
   pathogens that pose serious health risks.

2. Unsanitary Conditions: The presence of cockroaches in food preparation areas,
   sleeping areas, and bathrooms renders these spaces unsanitary and unusable.

3. Property Damage: Cockroaches contaminate food, damage property, and create
   foul odors.

4. Mental Distress: The constant presence of pests has caused significant stress
   and inability to peacefully enjoy my home.

These conditions violate the implied warranty of habitability and my right to a
safe, sanitary, and livable dwelling.

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

Under [State] law, landlords have a legal obligation to:

1. Maintain the premises in a habitable condition
2. Make necessary repairs to ensure habitability

The presence of a cockroach infestation violates these obligations and relevant
health codes.

REQUESTED ACTION

I am requesting that you take immediate action to address this infestation:

1. Hire a licensed pest control professional to inspect the premises
2. Implement a comprehensive treatment plan for the entire building
3. Identify and seal entry points and harborage areas
4. Provide a written timeline for remediation
5. Schedule follow-up treatments as necessary
6. Provide written confirmation when the infestation has been eliminated

TIMELINE FOR RESPONSE

I request a written response within [5] business days acknowledging receipt of
this letter and outlining your plan to address this issue. Treatment should
begin within [10] business days of this notice.

DOCUMENTATION NOTICE

Please be advised that I am maintaining detailed records of:
- All cockroach sightings (attached report)
- All communications regarding this issue
- Any delays in remediation
- Any expenses incurred due to this infestation

RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

I reserve all rights under [State] landlord-tenant law, including but not limited to:
- Rent withholding or rent abatement
- Repair and deduct remedies
- Termination of lease for breach of habitability
- Recovery of damages, costs, and attorney fees
- Filing complaints with local health departments or housing authorities

I prefer to resolve this matter cooperatively and promptly. However, if this
infestation is not addressed in a timely and effective manner, I will pursue all
available legal remedies.

schedule treatment.
