## Known Limitations (Addressed in Audit)

The following issues were identified during the initial build and fixed in the subsequent audit:

1. SQL injection vulnerability in pagination
2. Bare except clauses throughout
3. Missing input validation
4. No file size validation
5. Potential decompression bomb vulnerability
6. Missing error handling
7. Information leakage through error messages
8. SQL wildcard injection in search

All of these were addressed in commit 01850dd (see AUDIT.md).
