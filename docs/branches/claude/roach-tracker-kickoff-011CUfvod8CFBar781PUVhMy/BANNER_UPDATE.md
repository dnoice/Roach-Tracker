## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach

1. **Direct GitHub URL Reference**: Used absolute GitHub URL to ensure banner displays correctly on GitHub
2. **Markdown Image Syntax**: Standard markdown `![alt](url)` format
3. **Positioning**: Strategic placement after title, before subtitle
4. **Branch Reference**: Points to `main` branch for stability (banner exists there post-merge)

### Why Absolute URL

Using the full GitHub URL (`https://github.com/dnoice/Roach-Tracker/blob/main/...`) ensures:
- Proper rendering on GitHub repository page
- Consistent display across different views (repo, README preview, etc.)
- No relative path issues

---

## Context

This update was performed as a quick enhancement after the successful merge of PR #1. The main branch already contained the banner asset in `global-assets/images/`, so this was simply a matter of integrating the reference into the README for visual presentation.

**Previous PR**: #1 - "Roach Tracker Project Kickoff and Setup"
**Merge Commit**: 7019c62
**This Update**: Post-merge visual enhancement on the working branch

## Impact

**User Experience**:
- Improved first impression of repository
- Professional visual branding
- Clear project identity

**Technical**:
- No functional changes
- No dependencies added
- Pure documentation enhancement
- Minimal diff (+2 lines)
